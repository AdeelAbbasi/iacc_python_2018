# Sets


> Set is a collection very similar to lists but with no duplicate items.

> Braces are used to represent a set

> ```Set()``` -> creates a new empty set
>

> ```{‘apple’,’orange’}``` – set of 2 unique items
>
> Set supports almost all methods and functions we discussed in Lists



# Tuples



> Tuples are also similar to Lists but they cannot be updated or
> changed unlike Lists.
>
> Parenthesis are used to represent tuples
>
> ```()``` -> empty tuple
>
> ```(‘python’)``` -> A single element tuple
>
>``` (‘python’,’java’, ‘dotNet’)``` -> Tupel with 3 items

> Tuples supports all  functions from Lists but any method which update
> or change the List like append, pop etc..
