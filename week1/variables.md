Example :

    height_in_centimeters = height_in_inches * 2.54;

    height_in_inches = 6;

    height_in_inches = 5.8;


# Exercise


*Create a height variable :*

	
    height_in_inches = 6;

*Print height_in_inches variable*



    print height_in_inches;  

*Create a formula to convert height in inches to height in centimeters*
>



    height_in_centimeters = height_in_inches * 2.54;

*Print the height in centimeters*



    print height_in_centimeters

*Create variable to hold name of the training class :*
